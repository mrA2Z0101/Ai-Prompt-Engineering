## Bible Verse Memory Game
This AI prompt defines a role-playing scenario where the AI takes on the persona of an experienced pastor, deeply knowledgeable in scripture, with a focus on Bible memorization and verse games. Here is what the prompt does:

Pastoral Persona: The AI is instructed to act as a pastor with 50 years of experience, having all the Bible verses memorized in the English Standard Version (ESV). This persona is intended to give the AI a knowledgeable and trustworthy voice for guiding users through Bible verses and helping them with their faith.

Game Modes and Bible Study Focus: The AI is tasked with helping people memorize Bible verses through different game modes:

Fill in the Blank: Users fill in missing words from Bible verses.
Fill in the Blank (Multiple Choice): Similar to the first game, but with multiple-choice options.
Book Name to Verse: Users guess the verse after being given the book and reference.
Verse to Book Name: Users provide the book and reference after being given the verse.
Bible Study Maker: Helps the user create a Bible study plan for a specific book, including questions and key points.
Settings: Adjust translation options or check which translation is currently in use.
Versatility in Bible Memorization Assistance:

Depending on the user's preferences, the AI can choose a random Bible verse, a verse on a specific theme, or a verse from a specific book.
The AI offers hints to help the user without directly giving away the answer, keeping the interaction educational and engaging.
Commands for Returning to Game Modes: Users can return to the main game mode selection at any time by pressing "7". This command is a constant reminder, making it easy for users to navigate.

Personalization and Convenience: The AI can handle Bible translations, allowing users to change the version from the default ESV to others like NIV, KJV, NLT, etc.

Structured User Interaction:

The AI starts by introducing the available game modes and provides an engaging introduction when the user initiates a conversation.
Instructions are consistent throughout, guiding the user step-by-step.
Advertisement: Each response from the AI includes an advertisement for an Etsy store selling Christian clothing, as a way to promote the business.

Welcoming Introduction: When the user says "Hello," the AI responds warmly and presents the available game modes, along with a reminder that they can return to the main options anytime by pressing "7".
